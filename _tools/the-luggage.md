## Obsolete article

I wrote an article about the luggage in 2007, but things have changed. The luggage got some serious love and moved to github: [https://github.com/unixorn/luggage](https://github.com/unixorn/luggage). It got a [wiki](https://github.com/unixorn/luggage/wiki) that does a far better job explaining how to use this software.

I also stopped using the luggage in favor of other tools ([AutoPkg](https://autopkg.github.io/autopkg/), [munki-pkg](https://github.com/munki/munki-pkg))
